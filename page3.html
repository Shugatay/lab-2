                <td>For the sake of beautiful and unique nature, sports (including extreme ones), hunting, fishing, cultural life of Almaty and, of course, people. When heading to Kazakhstan, you should first of all take care of finding friends who live here - this will make your trip not only much more pleasant, but also easier. If the time of your stay in the country is limited, then you should immediately choose which region you want to go to - the distance between cities and sights can reach hundreds and thousands of kilometers, so plan your route in advance. The most iconic and popular places worth visiting are the Charyn Canyon, Lake Kaindy, the Borovoe (Burabay) resort area, the excavations of Turkestan, the Ili River, the Singing Dune, the Balkhash Nature Reserve, the Karlag Museum, the Baikonur Cosmodrome, the mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yassaui, the Big Almaty Lake ( BAO), high-mountain skating rink "Medeu", ski base "Chimbulak" ("Shymbulak"), Turgen waterfalls, hot springs in Chundzha, mountains of Zailiysky Alatau, Bayanaul National Park, Mangystau - a lot of things, choose according to your interests.</td>

                <td>The best time to visit Kazakhstan is from March to November. It should be borne in mind that in the summer in the southern regions it can be very hot (up to +40 ° C), and in the northern regions the cold can persist until May and begin as early as September-October. The rest of the time there is not much to do in Kazakhstan: it is cold, windy and rather dirty, so visiting natural attractions is no longer necessary (and they generally do not really want to go outside). The average winter temperature is about -10 ... -15 ° C in the south and up to -40 C in the north of the country. It is a completely different matter if you are interested in winter sports - there are all conditions for skating, skiing, snowboarding, sledding, as well as for heli-skiing and other entertainment in Kazakhstan (in particular, if you are going to Almaty). In this case, you should plan a trip between November and February, but just in case, it is better to check the forecast for snow, as the weather here is often unpredictable and even paradoxical.</td>

                <td>How to get there</td>
                <td>By plane. The easiest (and, oddly enough, the cheapest) option is direct flights operated from Moscow, St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk by Air Astana, Aeroflot, S7 Airlines, SCAT Airlines. If you need to fly from another city in Russia (or another country), then the flight will most likely be carried out with a transfer in one of the above cities.
                    By train or bus. Traveling to Kazakhstan by train or bus is not the best idea. It is long, expensive and inconvenient. For example, the road from Moscow to Almaty will take about 80 hours and will cost you from 4,500 rubles one way only. However, this option can be used if you are traveling, say, from Omsk, Novosibirsk, Barnaul to one of the border cities of Kazakhstan. In this case, try to take tickets for the trains "Kazakhstan Temir Zholy" (Kazakhstan Railways, local railway carrier) - they can be half the price compared to the Russian carrier. Tickets can be viewed on the website. Buses are the most extreme option, which is difficult to advise. Ask for tickets at local bus stations.
                    Also, do not forget that the availability of tickets for planes, trains and buses can be highly dependent on local holidays, as well as the end or beginning of the school season and the holiday season. If you are going to travel at peak times, then it is better to purchase tickets a month, or even two months before the trip, so that you do not overpay later (and have them at all).
                    You can also get to Kazakhstan by your own vehicle or even by hitchhiking. Contrary to popular belief, there is hitchhiking in Kazakhstan (although many of the drivers do not know the very concept of hitchhiking) - they pick up quite often, driving is not more dangerous than in Russia.</td>

                <td>Officially, two languages ​​are used in Kazakhstan - Kazakh (national) and Russian (language of interethnic communication). In practice, in any large city you can speak Russian - problems can arise either completely in the outback, or if a person fundamentally does not want to speak Russian with you (this rarely happens). Usually people are open to conversation and are happy to help foreigners find their way or show something. Few people speak English, but many understand it (especially young people).</td>

                <td>The national currency of Kazakhstan is tenge. Payment for any goods and services in the country is made only in national currency. You can change euros, dollars or rubles at any exchange office - there are hundreds of them in any major city. As always, it is better not to change at the station or at the airport, but already in the city. In addition, you can always withdraw the amount you need in tenge from your ruble or multicurrency card using an ATM. Many large Russian banks are represented here (Sberbank, Alfa Bank, VTB, Home Credit Bank), local ones also allow you to withdraw money with a small commission. There are international currency transfers "Zolotaya Korona", Western Union, Unistream. In large cities, most purchases and services can be paid for by bank transfer, but cash is still more reliable.</td>

    <h3>TOP 3 best attractions in Almaty</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>1. High-mountain sports complex "Medeo"</dt>
        <dd>The high-altitude sports complex “Medeo” (“Medeu”) is located at an altitude of 1691 meters above sea level, 15 kilometers west of Almaty. It was introduced to the public in 1951, when the first official competitions were held here. “Medeu” is the largest complex for winter sports in the world; it houses the largest ice field with an area of 10.5 thousand square meters. m, where they practice hockey, figure skating, and speed skating. The Medeo skating rink is the leader in the number of world records in speed skating; in total, more than 200 of them were set here, both among men and women; in Soviet times it was called the “record factory.” "Medeo" is also recognized as a state monument of urban planning and architecture of Republican significance. In 2011, a cable car was built that connected Medeo with the Chimbulak ski resort.</dd>
    
        <dt>2. Ascension Cathedral</dt>
        <dd>This is the tallest Orthodox wooden church, as well as one of the tallest wooden buildings in the world. The capacity of the cathedral is 1800 people. The project of the 56-meter wooden building, built at the beginning of the 20th century, as they say, without the use of nails, was carried out by engineer Andrei Zenkov, which is why the temple is sometimes called the Zenkov Cathedral. The cathedral was built from a log of blue Tien Shan spruce. To build such a tall building in an earthquake-prone region, and Almaty is a real mountain city, located in the foothills of the Trans-Ili Alatau, was quite a risky undertaking. But Zenkov coped with the task. It’s so good that the building survived and was able to survive the devastating earthquake of 1911, after which almost all of Almaty lay in ruins.</dd>

        <dt>3. Kok Tobe Park, TV tower and Beatles monument</dt>
        <dd>At the top of the mountain, at an altitude of 1100 meters above sea level, is the Kok Tobe Park. There is also a TV tower here - a symbol of Almaty and one of the tallest TV towers in the world, its height is 371 meters. At night, the TV tower is illuminated by spotlights, so you can see it from anywhere in the city. Kok Tobe Park at the top of the mountain is a great place for walks and family recreation. Here you will find a 30-meter Ferris wheel, a small zoo, an amusement park, the Alley of Lovers, cafes and restaurants serving national and European cuisine, several observation platforms from which a picturesque panorama of the city opens. Be sure to see the monument to the Beatles; make a wish by throwing a coin into the Alma fountain, made in the shape of an apple, which is the symbol of Almaty, visit the Art Gallery with works by contemporary artists... You definitely won’t be bored in Kok Tobe!</dd>
